aes-crypto-api-iface (0.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
  2017/01/27
    ! aes-crypto-api-iface.c:
        Fix -- we use a separate iv for each operation mode (encrypt & decrypt).
      [dg]

  2017/01/27
    + aes-crypto-api-iface.c:
        1) Add encrypt operation support.
           It is use separate control registers set for DMA & Crypto engine
           (include registers for key & iv).
           Now we write same key & iv in both (encrypt & decrypt) registers.

        2) Delete reading IRQ status in ISR.
           Now it is not necessary - FPGA has become more smart.

        3) Comment out obtaining IRQ numbers from .dtb
           Hardcoded IRQ to 72 for decrypt engine & 73 for encrypt engine.
           It is necessary to work with debug FPGA-firmware.

    ! aes-crypto-api-iface.c:
        Bugfix -- add copying decrypted plain text from temporary
        buffer to destination scatterlist buffers.
      [dg]

    ! aes-crypto-api-iface.c:
        Fix bug in temporary buffer offset calculation.
      [dg]

  2017/01/18
    * aes-crypto-api-iface.c:
        Fix NULL pointer dereference bug caused by ISR being registered before
        resources allocation.
      [io]

  2017/01/18
    * aes-crypto-api-iface.c:
        General code cleanup fixing indentation and braces placement.
      [io]

  2017/01/18
    * socfpga_cyclone5_etln.dts:
        Describe interrupt used by AES-accelerator's DMA controller.
      [io]

  2017/01/17
    + netdma.h,
    * aes-crypto-api-iface.c:
        Rewrite driver to make use of new features of FPGA firmware that
        include scatter-gather DMA and CBC mode of operation.

aes-crypto-api-iface (0.0.1-0) unstable; urgency=low
  2016/12/16
    + README.md:
        Few minor changes of README
      [io]

  2016/12/15
    + aes-crypto-api-iface.c:
        Initial version of AES-accelerator driver that supports
        in-kernel Crypto API interface.

        It supports only decryption now.

        It does not provide multi-block cipher and provides only
        single block cipher (see CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_CIPHER in
        include/linux/crypto.h)

        See README.
      [dg, io]

    ! aes-accelerator.c:
        Delete old version.
      [dg, io]
