    + README.md:
        Few minor changes of README
      [io]

  2016/12/15
    + aes-crypto-api-iface.c:
        Initial version of AES-accelerator driver that supports
        in-kernel Crypto API interface.

        It supports only decryption now.

        It does not provide multi-block cipher and provides only
        single block cipher (see CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_CIPHER in
        include/linux/crypto.h)

        See README.
